I'm Aidan Wilson, an eResearch Analyst with Intersect, a not-for-profit organisation that assists NSW universities with eResearch needs, including data analysis, software engineering, cloud computing and training. 
In a former life I was a documentary linguist, working on a number of Australian Aboriginal languages, and in 2013 completed a Masters thesis on Traditional Tiwi at Melbourne Uni.
